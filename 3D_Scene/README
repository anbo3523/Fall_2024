Time spent on this project: Spent about 6 hours on this project. 
                            Tree: Composed of a cylinder (trunk) colored brown and a cone (the leaf part) colored green.
                            Tire Swing: Was created using Song Ho's implementation of a torus (source listed in code) that I colored a dark grey and then attached a "string" by drawing a line from the tire to the cone on the tree colored yellow.
                            Flowers: Small circles drawn in a circle pattern scattered in the scene with a yellow circle in the middle of the flower.
                            Grass: A plain quad colored a darker green.
